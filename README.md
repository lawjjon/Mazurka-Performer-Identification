# Mazurka Performer Identification

Using machine learning techniques to identify piano performers from the Mazurka dataset.

The Jupyter Notebook, `Mazurka_audio.ipynb`, contains the code used to process the data and run the models for performer identification. It can be viewed in [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.org/github/lawjjon/Mazurka-Performer-Identification/blob/main/Mazurka_audio.ipynb) if GitHub will not display it. 

Note: This repository is part of the appendices for my dissertation on piano performer identification. The  code is for demonstration purposes only and cannot be run without access to the original audio recordings.
